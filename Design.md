"A gritty Cyberpunk 2077 prequel reboot set in the late Cold War era"

Prologue: You are Kirk Huscle, tasked by the president with stopping a Soviet ICBM from launching and starting WWIII or whatever.

Tutorial: The hacking system is a "Turing machine" which is a row of flashing player scale boxes. The player can run around in first person mode and use the boxes. Using a box changes its flashing color pattern. None of it means anything and there is no way to complete the challenge, which times out after 15 seconds.

Act I: After failing the tutorial, the player is in a car, for reasons. A butterfly is zipping around in front of the windshield, preventing the player from seeing past it. The player must swat the butterfly (quick action) before the timer expires. After 2-3 swats, the butterfly dies (omg why did you do that??) but the player bumps the dash, turning on the engine and moving the car forward, with loudly screeching tires.

Act II: The camera pulls up and points downward, revealing another car that appears to be inside a giant bottle in the player's path. There are no controls and the car crashes. The car model is replaced by a destroyed car model and the engine flies toward the camera. It is important for each of these assets to be at least 5x the size of all other assets combined.

Act III: The camera pulls up further and the cars are revealed to be on top of a flatbed train car attached to an oil tanker car. The crash makes the train start rolling toward a broken part of the track.

Act IV: The camera pulls back and reveals the train tracks are on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier. The Soviet ICBM the player is supposed to stop is in launch position at the end of the tracks. The train derailing causes the train to miss its intended target. However, it does cause the aircraft carrier to start moving toward an iceberg.

Epilogue: If the player swatted the butterfly, the ship sinks and the ICBM is unable to launch. The camera zooms in on the car in the bottle, bobbing in the waves.

Otherwise the ICBM launches, wearing a comically sized cowboy hat.

Planned DLC: A level that takes place entirely inside the glove compartment called Escape From Swat The Fly: Swat Another Slightly Different Fly
